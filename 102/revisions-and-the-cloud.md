# Revisions and the Cloud

Basic git commands used so far by us in class are add, commit, status, push.
for example ``git add [filename]``. You can pull data from your respository and edit them in your text editor and send them back for updates. A cool thing about Git is that it helps keep track of all versions of a file and this helps with keeping track of the evolution of the file itself. It's also useful for others when working in a team as colaborators can contribute and view changes, though permissions are needed before reuploading into a respository that's not yours. Be careful to not edit on the cloud side as that my create conflicts when trying to add revisions from your local machine.
