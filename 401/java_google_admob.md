## Google AdMob (we’re using this to display ads)

**How are the ads shown in your application determined when using Google AdMob?**

> You create ad space in your app. You make your app ad spaces available by creating ad units in AdMob. You choose where you want the ads to appear when you add the ad units to your app code. Ads can be displayed in a number of formats and are seamlessly added to built-in UI components.

**What are the platforms which support Google AdMob?**

Currently AdMob supports Android, iOS, Unity, C++, Flutter and AdMobAPI
