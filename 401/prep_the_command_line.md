# The Command Line - Prep Work

## Intro - Command Line

In the Introduction in Ryan's Tutorial, They talk about what the command line, aka terminal, being a text based interface to the system.

In the terminal to look at what is in the directory or file you could use `ls` to see which files and directories are there in the current directory you're in. You could add a command line argument (`ls -l`) to have optional behaviour.

## Navigation

`pwd` lets you see where you're located by showing you your current directory and the path to your location.

What's in the current location, use `ls` to show what is there.

Absolute and Relative Paths talk about where a file or directory is located in relation to the root directory (absolute) or from your current location (relative)

Absolute path is denoted with a `/` at the beginning of the path and its subdirectories after.

`cd` is used to change your directory followed by the path of your file or directory.
