## Upgrade Your Technical Skills with Deliberate Practice

This article talks about how important it is to do a deep-dive when practicing and upgrading technical skills. There is a cycle that starts with pushing oneself to challenge ourselves, putting yourself through it and getting feedback on the results in an agile format, kind of like naming the good, the bad, and what can we improve on to make the next day successful; in our retros.

## The power of believing that you can improve

The video talks about how learning obstacles may be overcome by having a growth mindset and thinking that a challenge is a positive instead of crumbling in the tragedy of not being able to understand it now. Just calmly assess the problem and locate a possible solution. This can happen within the same amount of time as being frustrated. Engage and develop the skill instead of running away. Go through the process. Things can be thought and we are capable of learning it.

## The power of passion and perseverance

Having more grit and solid work ethic is likely an indicator in overcoming a hardship. I can stick to it and reach out for more when ready.
