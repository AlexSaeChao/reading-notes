# Spring Boot and OAuth2

In non-technical terms, describe what using OAuth can provide for your application.
OAuth is a secure and convenient way for you app to access certain information or do certain things on behalf of the user with actual using their username and password first.

An analogy:

You're going to a concert and you got through the gates and are greeted at reception. They give you a Wrist band (OAuth Token) depending on what tyou may be cleared for like a VIP pass. This wrist band will show the staff/security(auth server) that you've been cleared to access the back stage as a VIP to get some photos and signatures from the musicians and artists (the content you are trying to access). You probably won't have access to the talents resting area in the back as there are limitations on your wrist band (scope and permissions of access).

Which authentication providers are covered in the tutorial?

Google and GitHub are two popular examples of authentication providers that are covered in this tutorial, among many others. As part of their services, both offer authentication mechanisms that allow users to log in to third-party applications using their Google or GitHub accounts, respectively.

## Things I want to know more about

Besides PII and sensitive information, what other information or content should have limited access too?
