## Purely functional programming, from Wikipedia

Can you change the state of a data structure using functional programming?

To change the state of a data structure in functional programming, you typically create a new copy of the data structure with the desired changes applied. This is known as "immutability." Instead of modifying the original data, you create a new version of it with the modifications. This approach ensures that the original data remains unchanged and that each step in the process is transparent and easy to reason about.

Define purely functional programming.

Purely functional programming is a programming paradigm where programs are built using purely functional concepts. It emphasizes the use of immutable data and pure functions, which means functions that don't have side effects and always produce the same output for the same input.

How do you think purely functional programming will differ from the programs youâ€™ve written so far in this course?

In object oriented programming, those paradigms had mutable state and side effects are common. Purely functional programming, Instead of thinking about how to modify data in place, you'll be encouraged to think about creating new data structures that reflect the changes you want to make.
