## Ethics in the workplace

The code I’m still ashamed of by Bill Sourour

Bill addresses the ethical delimmas that software developers might come accross throughout their careers. Highlighting these concerns, the ACM Code of Ethics emphasizes the duty of computing professionals to act with integrity, prioritize the welfare of the public, and evade causing harm. This article tells us a scenario where ethical ambiguity led to unintended repercussions. A particularly point from the article is recognizing the impact of coding decisions on the real world. When I came across the part where a quiz was skewed to favor a specific drug recommendation, alarm bells sounded in my mind. These design choices stand in contrast to the ACM's principles, which champion honesty and trustworthiness.

Although I firmly believe that the coder wasn't solely at fault, they should have raised concerns about the ethical dimensions of their task. People's actions are heavily influenced by how information is framed to them. At the end of the day, however, actions are done and commited by the user.

Personally, I would likely feel similarly burdened, haunted by the tragedy of the young girl's demise, even if I wasn't directly responsible for that decision.

## Ethics in Technology

Big Data can drive societal changes, but its misuse can result in discrimination and privacy invasion. The change from a data-scarce to a data-abundant model affects data collection and usage, necessitating ethical data handling.

I agree with the article's view on Big Data. It highlights the potential of Big Data for advancements and its capacity to discriminate. The example of American Express adjusting credit limits based on shopping history shows the dangers when ethics are not considered. The link between personalization and discrimination suggests a thin line between them. As technology advances, there's a need to set ethical boundaries to avoid misuse of all this collection of data.
