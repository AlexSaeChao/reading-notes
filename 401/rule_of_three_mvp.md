## Don’t Repeat Yourself but consider the Rule of Three

Are there any projects that you’ve built during your time at Code Fellows (or prior) which could benefit from applying the Rule of Three to DRY up your code?

There probably are, no doubt I can spend an infinte amount of time on past projects to dust them off. I could probably do it to the currrent lab we're working on as we did make 3 similar Establishment classes.

Explain how you would dry up your code if you noticed that you are repeating the same logic in multiple places?

After finding instances of repeated code, I would extract the logic and make it into a function or method. Then I would replace the repeated code with the function call. Test it thoroughly to make sure expect output/behaviour is occuring.

## You Aren’t Gonna Need It and Minimum Viable Product

Describe some benefits of releasing an MVP of a product.

You have a product that is complete enough to build upon more when time permits. That's when You Aren't Gonna Need It makes that possible.
Again yyou have a product for market. Having an MVP allows unallocated time to be placed on other tasks. You can also get early feedback on you product.

What are some potential pitfalls of waiting until a product is fully mature to release it.

You maybe overinvesting time and resources for a product the market won't take. Having user feedback in the context of the real world will be impacted because of market validation ins't being considered. You also lose valuable information and learnings if there is is nothing to show.

## Things I want to know more about

Besides not being complete with a product, what are other reasons why holding back a release maybe a good thing?
