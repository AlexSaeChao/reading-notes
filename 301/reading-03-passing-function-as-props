# Passing Functions as Props



## React Docs - lists and keys

What does .map() return?

.map() returns a new array with a function applied to each element of the original array. 

If I want to loop through an array and display each value in JSX, how do I do that in React?

You would map out your array of numbers arrow it to a list of numbers. Then you use ReactDom to get element by ID and render the list there.

```
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const listItems = numbers.map((numbers) =>
  <li>{numbers}</li>
);

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')); 
root.render(<ul>{listItems}</ul>);
```

Each list item needs a unique `key`.

What is the purpose of a key?

Keys help React ID which which items have been modified, added, or removed. Keys should be nested withing the element inside the array to give the elements a stable identity.
