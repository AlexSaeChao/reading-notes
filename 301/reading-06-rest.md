# REST

The first topic is about an article titled "What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team," which explores the impact of psychological safety on work experiences and informs the approach to working with others. The second topic is a brief explanation of REST (Representational State Transfer) and Roy Fielding's involvement in creating the HTTP protocol, along with descriptions of various HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and PATCH, which are used for retrieving, adding, replacing, and partially updating information in systems.

## What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team

To what extent did psychological safety impact your previous work experience?

My previous work did have some parts of psych safety but was a bit more authoritive in nature as we could not take so much risk and there were relationsips and dynamics that some could not get over.

How does this article inform your approach to working with others moving forward?

When working with others, try and get to know them but don't push when things are reserved or just not to share. Also it seems like there have been a lot of studies so far with jsut small incremental changes that when combined together has a larger impact than we could've thought.

## How I explained REST to my brother

Who is Roy Fielding?

Roy Fielding is a persson who helped write the first web servers, to send docs across the web, explaining why the web works the way it does.

Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use in this class work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

The techniques won't work well in that context because they were not designed to do so.

What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

Hypertext Transfer Protocol, an application-layer protocol that allows the fetching of resourses like HTML docs, images, and videos from web servers and display them to web browsers.

What does a GET do?

>Each of the systems would retrieve information from each other using a simple HTTP GET

What does a POST do?

>If one system needs to add something to another system, it would use an HTTP verb of POST

What does PUT do?

>if a system wants to replace something in another system, it uses an HTTP verb of PUT

What does PATCH do?

>to do a partial update, it'll hopefully use PATCH
