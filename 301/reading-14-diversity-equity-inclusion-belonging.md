Ask the question: Why diversity matters to your tech company

When are diversity efforts most successful?

Why do diverse companies perform better?

They have a wider range of perspectives, ideas, and experiences at their disposal. With that, companies that have more diversity can approach challenges from multiple angles that others may not have. They can also better understand a wider range of potential services and needs of the customer.

Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.

If you have a member of a community member they should have insight on the community they are with. by better understanding what the community needs they know what they want the expected outcome to be for services rendered. If a user base is that more diverse a company may want a member of the user base to tap into that broader user base.
