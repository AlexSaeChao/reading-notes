## An Introduction to Node.js and Pair Programing

This section talks about what is a node and npm and an high level overview of what can they do. This section also has an overview of pair programing.

What is node.js?

> There are plenty of definitions to be found online. Let’s take a look at a couple of the more popular ones. This is what the project’s home page has to say:
> Node.js® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine.

> And this is what Stack Overflow has to offer:
> Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.

In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?

The V8 engine is responsible for reading and executing JavaScript Code. It takes the JavaScript code and compiles it to machine code so that it could be processed but the computers CPU outside of the browser.

What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?

It means that the the node provides an environment that for running JavaScript outside the web browser. Tradionally JavaScript is executed in the browser itself but this runtime environment can run code on through the computers CPU or server.

What is npm?

Npm is a package manager that is bundled with Node. Npm allows devs to install, manage, and share reusable code packages called npm packages or modules.

What version of node are you running on your machine?

In the terminal, with the command `node --version` you can find the npm version on your machine. My npm is currently v19.9.0.

What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’?

In the terminal, with the command `npm --version` you can find the npm version on your machine. My npm is currently 9.6.3.

What is node used for?

Node is used for:

* Server side web development
* Making APIs
* Making Real-Time Applications
* Serverless Applications

## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?

> 1. Greater efficiency
> 2. Engaged collaboration
> 3. Learning from fellow students
> 4. Social skills
> 5. Job interview readiness
> 6. Work environment readiness

In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?

For me, 1-4 of the 6 are what I have found to be most benefical.

How does pair programming work?

There are 2 common roles, the one who drives and the one who navigates. The one who drives usually will drive the writing aspect of the code. While the one who navigates will provide resourses and guide the driver while scanning for typos and bugs.

## Things I want to know more about

Is there another reason why V8 engine is called that besides being named after a car's V8 engine?
