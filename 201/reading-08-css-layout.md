How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?

*Main axis refers the row the items are being laid out on from left to right. It is controlled by the flex-direction property. The cross axis refers to the column from top to bottom and is controlled by the align-items property. The order property can reorder the flex items can make it difficult for screen readers to understand the visual layout.*
