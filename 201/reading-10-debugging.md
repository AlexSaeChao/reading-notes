## Debugging

### What Went Wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript.

Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.

Syntax errors are spelling errors in your code. Like the missing semi-colons and things of that sort.
Logic errors are when the spelling is correct but the code is not what you intended it to do. A bit more difficult to correct than syntax errors.

List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.

most definately had syntax errors. I feel like I had some logic errors but had a TA walk me through them, telling me how the code is being read.

How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?

I believe a large part of debugging is a KPI of success within my long term goal. Meaning if I know how the code works or need to fix it and I can, it means I understand programming at its core.


### The JavaScript Debugger

How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?

Debugger tools usually check if there are any syntax errors and errors in the logic of the code. There is usually a setting you can toggle on or off. the tool can also pause the execution of code called breakpoint

Define what a breakpoint is.

A pause in the execution of code. it lets you examine the variables while the code is in mid execution.

What is the call stack?

Call stack is part of the debugging tool and it shows you wwhat code has executed to get to the current line you are on.

### Things I want to know more about

This section, debugging, is probably where I should spend my time on since I believe knowing how to read the JavaScript code is one of the most important part that directly indicates that you have a solid foundation of the langauge.
