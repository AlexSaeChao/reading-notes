There are three ways to use CSS to HTML, there are inline styles, internal styles, and external styles. Inline and internal styles are used inside the HTML document. Inline styles are put into the tags directly in the html. Internal styles use a style tag. External is used in a separate CSS document from the HTML doc and will have the lowest priority to be applied used with a link tag.
* Why should we avoid using inline styles?
    - Inline is used on the line direct which will have the highest priority of the 3. Though you may not want to use it as it may be difficult to maintain. Meaning if you want edits and editing the CSS document doesn't change it, you may have to dig through the HTML document to search for the inline code.

    ```
   h2 {
     color: black;
