# Object-Oriented Programming, HTML Tables

*Explain why we need domain modeling.*

Domain modeling is needed because it can get information and return it to us so we can understand issues if and when they occur. it does this by defining terms, defining boundaries and scope. identifying requirements and helps us design solutions to help mitigate unwanted outcomes.  

*Why should tables not be used for page layouts?*

* They reduce the accessibility for visually impaired users
* The make it more difficult to debug and maintain the page
* Tables are not automatically responsive and usually are sized by the content they store.

*List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML `<table>`.*

`<th>`: this is the table's header cells, used to name columns and rows of the table.
`<td>`: creates standard cells that contain data for the body of the table
`<table>`: used to create the table itself, contains `<tr>` which are rows

*What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?*

A constuctor is called when a new object is created using the `new` keyword. They are reusable code. You can change the behavoirs of an object by changing just one area. You could make them inherit traits of another as well.

*How does the term `this` differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?*

When `this` is used in a object literal it refers to the object where `this` is being used while in a constructor, `this` talked about the object being created by the constructor.

*Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience.
NOTE: This is a very common front end developer interview question*

From my past experience of crafting things, prototypes in general are just like creating a template. With this template you can follow the design and alter it when needed to design something new. But since your using the template to create the new design there are some traits that are inherited from the template.
