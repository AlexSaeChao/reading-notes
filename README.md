Growth mindset is a how we as humans challenge our thinking for growth. 

*There are 5 main points to growth mindset, in no particular order.* 
1. How we see challenges. Things may be difficult right now but with time we will get there, don't surrender.
2. How we see obstacles and how we overcome them. Obstacles come in all sizes. Again with time and consistant practice we can get somewhere.
3. The effort we put in, we recieve back in what we know and how to utilize them to our benefit. Don't full-baking half-baked things.
4. Criticism has been seen as negative feedback but really asking for feedback, we learn what make sense and learn from others as well as using self assessments to progress from there. 
5. Learning from the success of others help you see the world in a different way. If your peers are ahead, they are another resource for you if time is available.
